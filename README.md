# password-generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to attempt to create a password generator in order to become more familiar with using javascript. The motivation behind this project was to problem solve in javascript so that I would have a better understanding of what it is I am trying to accomplish. The different problems which I solved included, breaking down syntax and understanding how arrays can can be used in different scenarios based on boolean requirements. I learned many things during this project, such as using the concat syntax and all the other different methods of manipulating arrays such as shift, unshift, join, push, pop. As well as understanding why certain things didn't work until I realized they were syntax errors. This method of doing a password generator isn't the safest or most efficient password generator but it is a good stepping stone to get me thinking.

In order to use the password generator you have to open up the index.html file in one of your browser and press the generate password button and then a password will be provided to you.

If you want to use the password generator as I stated previously open it in your default browser and press the generate password button.
